ABOUT
One of the issues in CRM is duplicate or unstructured data.  This is an attempt to structure countries, states and cities.
Users will be presented with a choice of countries rather than being asked to input it themselves.  Same for states.
Geo cities is a useful table to have but is optional.  

SETTING UP
- Create directory: in your rails app, create a data/geo directory
- Create the files as described below.  

Create files:
- countries.csv
  * Derived from the cia worldfact site
    "Country","FIPS104","ISO2","ISO3","ISON","Internet","Capital","MapReference","NationalitySingular","NationalityPlural","Currency","CurrencyCode","Population","Title","Comment"
- states.csv
  * Retrieve from http://www.maxmind.com/app/fips10_4, also http://www.maxmind.com/app/iso3166_2.  I swapped out the US and Canadian states for their corresponding iso3166_2 mates.
- GeoLiteCity-Location.csv: 
  * retrieve from http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
  * also be sure to trim out the first line (copyright) from the data file so it can be loaded properly
  * The migration task expects the file to be UTF-8 and maxmind exports its file in ISO-8859-1.  You can convert the file as follows:
     iconv --from-code=ISO-8859-1 --to-code=UTF-8 infile > outfile

RAKE TASKS:
- To load the state and country data into the database, do:
 rake fluxx_crm:geo geo_dir="<geo_dir_path>"
- To load the geo cities data:
 rake fluxx_crm:geo_cities geo_dir="<geo_dir_path>"

Be sure to replace <geo_dir_path> with the path to your directory of geo files.

You can run the tasks multiple times if you have updated information, it will not overwrite your data.  This allows you to add in updated data.

Note that this uses ActiveRecord to process every single row, and there are 200K+ rows in the city database, so you will need to be patient to load in the city data.
ActiveRecord was used over a db-specific variant such as mysql's LOAD DATA INFILE to maintain DB-agnosticism.  You may want to implement your own way to load data in if loading speed is a problem.
